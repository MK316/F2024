# ðŸŒ€ Phonology & English Education (Fall 2024)

This course provides an introduction to English phonology, focusing on the sound system of English, and the rules and principles that govern its pronunciation. Additionally, it covers fundamental concepts in phonetics to help students grasp the articulation of English sounds (Basic Phonetics). Designed specifically for students preparing for careers in English education, this course equips future English teachers with the necessary skills to articulate, describe, and teach English pronunciation effectively. Throughout the course, students will explore phonological differences between Korean and English. This knowledge will enable them to anticipate and address the specific challenges Korean learners might face when learning English pronunciation, enhancing their teaching effectiveness.

## COURSE OBJECTIVES:
The goals of the course are (1) to give students practical skills to describe English sounds and sound patterns, (2) to familiarize them with the main theoretical concepts in phonology, and (3) to help students apply their phonetic/phonological knowledge in identifying patterns within the sound systems of English.
