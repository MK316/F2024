# English Phonology (Fall 2024)

This course introduces students to the study of English phonology, the phonological grammar of English, and discusses why and how this grammar is relevant to teaching English as a second or foreign language. The course will cover basic concepts necessary to understand the sound patterns of English from both descriptive and theoretical perspectives. Students will learn the fundamentals of the English sound system and acquire some characteristic phonological patterns of English to prepare themselves as future English teachers. Additionally, the course will include practice tests to familiarize students with the types of questions commonly found on teaching licensure examinations.

## COURSE OBJECTIVES:

The goals of the course are (1) to give students practical skills to describe English sounds and sound patterns, (2) to familiarize them with the main theoretical concepts in phonology, (3) to help students apply their phonetic/phonological knowledge in identifying patterns related to the sound systems of English, (4) to provide experience with Teacher Exam preparation in the area of phonetics/phonology, enabling them to gain confidence in preparing for the exam.
